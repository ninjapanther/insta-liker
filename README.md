# Insta-Liker
>An autoliker script for Instagram.

### Tech Stack  
- Selenium Webdriver
- Chrome Driver (included in the repository)
- Python3

### Python libraries used:
1. os
2. time
3. getpass
4. sys

## How to Use:
- Make sure selenium and Chrome are installed on your system.
  - Selenium Installation(from command line): pip install selenium 
  - You probably know how to install Chrome
- Clone this repository, get to the directory and run using 'python3 automation.py'
- Provide your instagram username and password (It is not stored and deleted as soon as program stops!)
- Povide the number of posts you wish to like.
- ENJOY!

### Future Plans:
1. Use headless browser. I tried to use chrome-headless but its quite slow.
2. Add functionality of liking all the posts of a particular person that you are following.
3. Improve scrolling and error checking.
